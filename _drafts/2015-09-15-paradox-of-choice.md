I was cruising Redit this week and came across a post asking similar questions to the ones below in /r/dotnet
It brought to my mind some thoughts I've been having for awhile now, but I decided to write them down and really think through them.

Here are the questions.

1. Is JavaScript/Node better than C#? Is it faster?
2. Is it possible to forget about C#, and have a prosperous career as a JavaScript developer on both back and front-end?
3. People are saying JavaScript is a bad idea for large projects. Is this true?
4. Is it better to use Cordova/Phonegap/Xamarin or go native with Swift/ObjectiveC/Java?

TL;DR: Great teams and great developers deliver quality products on any stack!

1. Is JavaScript/Node better than C#? Is it faster?

As a .NET developer and recreational Node user, I've asked this question myself. Now, I don't think the first part of the question is possible to answer, and I could care less about the second one. Even if you could show me the benchmarks. Unless there's a HUGE difference (which there's not) it doesn't matter! 

It goes along with the paradox of choice, analysis by paralysis, and YAGNI.

I think many developers today are getting a little dazed and confused (gif of confusion / basketball court up and down) with questions like:

"Which mvc framework is the best?"
"Which has the best performance"
"I'm on stack x, but everyone is praising stack y and saying how it's the best thing since sliced bread. Should I jump ship to y?"

This post is as much as a reminder for me as it is for the community at large. I think we need to remember one of the key agile principles of YAGNI. In other words, choose the right tool for the job and the tool that solves the current problems in front of you. You probably don't have to worry about scaling your app for hundereds of thousands of users when you have 0 users. Just write the thing, and solve the problems as they come!

.NET in particular may be struggling with this. "Everyone is talking about Node, Node Node Node". And Node is great, but if you've been doing .NET for 10+ years. Stick with what you know, and jump to NOde when it solves a problem you can't in .NET.

Get your ideas down and improve them as you go.
