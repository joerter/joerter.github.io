It's a wonderful time to be a software developer. The opportunities are abundant, and the languages, frameworks, and tooling we use to do our jobs are amazing thanks in large part to our collaborative efforts in the open source world.

One negative aspect I see of this proliferation of excellent libraries and frameworks ready for production use, is the consumer mindset it can bring forth in developers. I think we all struggle with it, and my own struggles in this area are what inspired me to write this post.

I've put together three characteristics of a developer with a consumer or user mindset, and three contrasting characteristics of a developer with an engineer's mindset. I would love to hear you feedback on these, and this topic in general. Any additional characteristics of users vs engineers would be wonderful as well!

## A user follows the trends and always picks their technology stack based on what's hot and popular.
## An engineer looks at all the factors when choosing a stack, and isn't afraid to pick something old or uncool.
This is one I find myself struggling with the most. Take JavaScript for example. We all know there's a new hot framework or trend emerging every day. This is great because we're driving the web, and technology in general forward, but we also need to be careful to not just simply be a trend follower, dumping our current framework for what's hot like we do with our phones.

One thing I have to remind myself of all the time is that a great developer or team can build a tremendous product using any antiquated technology. There are teams of developers right now that are killing it with ASP.NET Web Forms. They're delivering value to their business because their teamwork, process, and collective skill has transcended the need to use the latest and greatest.

When choosing a stack, engineers consider all the factors involved. That includes business constraints, existing systems, team experience, and many others. They're not afraid to pick a stack that is old or gets a lot of hate online. At the end of the day, the most important objective to them is delivering value. Does the average user care if they'r application was created using .NET/Java/Node/AngularJS/React/Ember? Not even a little bit. They care about the application's functionality and reliability. Both of which can be achieved in any stack.

## A user gains experience in one language or stack and uses it to solve every problem that comes their way.
## An engineer is constantly adding new looking to broaden their horizons so that they can pick the best tool for the job.
At first glance, this characteristic might seem like it conflicts with the first. The point I'm trying to get across with this characteristic is similar to the hammer analogy. A user discovers or gains experience using a specific technology, and soon every problem looks like the nail that technology was built to solve. Similarly, a user might discover the hottest framework, and say "This is the end all be all! The end to all our problems!"

Users get emersed in one technology or vendor, and don't keep up with competing products and ideas. They are loyal to this vendor like they are with any other consumer product or brand. They even have holy wars with other developers about why their chosen stack is the best.

Engineers know that there will never be an end all be all technology suitable for all problems they encounter. They prefer to stay technology and vendor agnostic. This allows them to experiment and learn about the strengths and weaknesses of new projects, and apply that knowledge when it comes time to pick a technology for a production project. 
## A user contributes nothing back to the community of the projects they rely on. They may encouter problems, and build elegant solutions, but they never share their knowledge back to make the project stronger.
## An engineer contributes back to the projects they rely in the form of code, documentation, blog posts, Stack Overflow answers, etc.

We sound like customers shopping for the best products, and jumping ship to the
latest and greatest model instead of engineers

Users shop around for the best product. They jump ship to the latest and greatest model, or the new hot competitor.
Engineers weigh the pros and cons of their tools, and how they fit into the problem.
