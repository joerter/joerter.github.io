These are some thoughts that have been swirling in my head for awhile now, and I'm finally writing them down. I hope they make sense and are helpful to you, dear Reader.

As software developers, we should favor practices and processes that create well-designed systems with clean code over languages and frameworks.

The only thing the users of your system care about is quality. Your boss might care a little more about your chosen stack, but do you think that he/she can debate with you about the advantages and disadvantages of Angular vs. Ember vs. TheNewHottness.js? Wait, your boss doesn't know the difference between Java and JavaScript do they? Yeah, that's what I thought. And I'm not at all dogging on the stereotypical project manager's technical ignorance. It's just simply not their job. Their job is to manage the delivery of a quality product.

In my especially impulsive moments, I wish I wasn't a .NET developer. I get upset about the bloat of Visual Studio, or the lack of

"Yeah my app is written in Angular, but.. Angular 2 and stuff.. And React is gaining a lot of steam... "

I think all developers have some kind of fear of obsolesence and not being able to stay up to speed with the constantly changing software development landscape. We're afraid of our skills becoming obsolete, and not useful anymore. But there's a reason so many companies are still running mainframes, COBOL, and PHP (lol - jk). They get the job done.

What technology solves the problems you have today?
